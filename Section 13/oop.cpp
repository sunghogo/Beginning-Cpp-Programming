    Procedural Programming:
        - Programs are a collection of functions, so Focus is on the processes
        - Data is declared separately, and passed as arguments into functions
    
    Procedural Programming Limitations:
        - Functions need to know the structure of the data so not adaptable to changes in data structure
        - As programs scale, they become difficult to maintain, extend, and debug

    Object-Oriented Programming:
        - Centered around classes and objects
        - Abstraction:
            - Classes model higher level real-world domain entities
        - Encapsulations:
            - Objects contain data AND operations that work on that data
            - Abstract Data Type (ADT)
            - Information-hiding implementation-specific logic from users
        - Reusability:
            - Easier to reuse classes in other applications
        - Inheritances:
            - Can create new classes in terms of reusing existing classes
            - Polymorphic classes
        - Polymorphism:
            - Different behavior depending on the data

    Limitations:
        - Not a panacea
            - May not be suitable for certain problems
            - Entities may not decompose neatly to a class
        - Steeper learning curve
        - More up-front design (to create good models and hoerarchies)
        - Usually larger in size, slower, and more complex
