/*
    Multiple Inheritance:
        - Occurs when a derived class inherits from two or more Base classes at the same time
            - The Base classes may belong to unrelated class hierarchies

        class Derived_Class:
            public Base_Class_1, public Base_Class_2 {
                ...
            };

        - Some compelling use-cases but easily misused
        - Can be very complex
