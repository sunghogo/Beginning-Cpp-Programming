        - A variable who value is an address (of another var or func)
        - Used to:
            - Access data outside of scope
            - Operate on arrays efficiently
            - Allocate memory dynamically on heap or free store
            - Polymorphism in OO
            - Access specific memory address for embedded/systems app
    
    Declaring pointers:
        variable_type *pointer_name {nullptr};
        - Initialize to nullptr (C+11, points to 0)
